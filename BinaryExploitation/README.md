# Piesangvisbank Breach Challenge

## Scenario

Banks are known for their reliance on old, stable code for security systems, as these legacy systems are often deemed reliable and efficient. You’ve recently discovered that Piesangvisbank, a local bank near you, is using C for its backend systems. You’ve obtained a piece of their code and found a vulnerability: an outdated function, `gets()`, that’s widely known to be unsafe. Your goal is to exploit this flaw using binary exploitation techniques. Bypass the password check, trigger debug mode, and retrieve the flag (password) stored in `password.txt`.

## Objective

- **Gain Shell Access**: Exploit the overflow to bypass password validation and trigger `debug()`.
- **Capture the Flag**: Once in the shell, locate and read the `password.txt` file.

## Flag

The flag is the content of `password.txt`, which includes the password phrase: `COS330_wAs_Too_Fun_2024_*`

## Hints (Cost 2 points each)

- **Hint 1**: Use a debugger like GDB to determine the return address for `debug()`.
- **Hint 2**: Calculate the exact overflow offset to overwrite the return address in `checkPassword()`.
- **Hint 3**: Review how `gets()` can cause buffer overflows to understand the vulnerability.
