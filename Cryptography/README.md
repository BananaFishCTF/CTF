# Ancient Shift

## Challenge Description
While exploring an old library, you discovered a dusty manuscript with a strange message. The text appears to be in English, but it's somehow... shifted. The librarian mentioned something about Julius Caesar being fond of this type of writing.

Message: `Pbatenghyngvbaf! Lbh unir fbyirq gur pnrfne pvcure. Urer vf lbhe synt: PPG{ebg13_vf_abg_pelcgb}`

## Hints
1. Caesar was known for shifting letters by a fixed number (cost: 10 points)
2. Try different shifts from 1-25, or use an online tool (cost: 20 points)

## Solution (Hidden from participants)
This is a ROT13 cipher (Caesar cipher with 13-shift). The decrypted message reads:
"Congratulations! You have solved the caesar cipher. Here is your flag: CTF{rot13_is_not_crypto}"
